							<p>I'm a young, energetic, and passionate data analyst with a zest for life and a deep commitment to making a positive impact. Born in Vietnam, I embarked on my professional journey at 19, diving into the service industry in F&B, where I spent four enriching years. My time in the service industry honed my communication, teamwork, and problem-solving skills, laying a strong foundation for my future endeavors.</p>
							<p>My passion for the beauty and fashion world has always been a core part of who I am. Whether it’s staying on top of product trends, understanding consumer behaviors, or analyzing market shifts, I find genuine excitement in how data shapes the brands and experiences people love.</p>
							<p>Beyond work, I'm an outdoorsy soul with a deep appreciation for photography, especially film and vintage cameras. Capturing moments from my travels keeps me grounded and fuels the creative perspective I bring into my professional life. Exploring new places and cultures continually inspires me to think more openly and approach my work with curiosity.</p>
							<p>While my path has been anything but traditional, my goal has always been clear: to become the most successful first-generation professional in my family and use that success to uplift others. I hope to turn my achievements into meaningful contributions through charity, mentorship, and community support.</p>
							<p>Blending curious thinking with creativity, culture, and a genuine passion for marketing, fashion, and healthcare, I'm excited for the journey ahead—and for the opportunity to make an impact in industries that inspire me.</p>
